  <p class="text-white font-bold">
    The Coral Collection was a very simple contact manager that had an aquatic
    theme to it. The MySQL database was extremely simple, with only two tables:
    one for registered users and one for contacts added by users. RESTful calls
    to the database were done using PHP. I was in charge of the database, and
    made some of the APIs.
