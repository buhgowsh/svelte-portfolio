      Gnarp Notes is a study tool that takes in PDF files from users and
      converts them into flash cards using the Google GeminiAPI, with an option
      to download the generated flash cards as a PowerPoint to use to study
      later. This was a solo hackathon project that I created during
      Gemiknights, an AI focused hackathon hosted by Knight Hacks at UCF. The
      overall design of the project went through a couple iterations, but the
      core theme of Gnarpy the alien cat stayed the same. Converting the flash
      cards into a downloadable PowerPoint was the most challenging part of the
      project, since finding and implementing the library I used (pptxgenjs)
      took most of the time I had.
